# FeatureMatching for VisualSFM

This is a simple program that:
- Detects key points and compute's their descriptors for all images in /inputFiles/images/ using ORB
- Writes these key points to files in sift format (with names matching the image name) to /outputFiles/features
- Matches the descriptors, then prints a match.txt file in /outputFiles.
- Writes all descriptors to .yml files (with names matching the image name) to /outputFiles/descriptors

### Why is this useful?

- The .sift files and matches.txt files are in the correct format to be loaded into [VisualSFM](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/), which will run structure from motion and bundle adjustment to create a point cloud of the scene.
- The .yml files allow the descriptors to be read into other programs if required.

i.e. The descriptors can be used to match the train image set (in /inputFiles/images) to a video stream / other images, and can also be used to map key points in a video stream / image to points in the point cloud generated by VisualSFM.
